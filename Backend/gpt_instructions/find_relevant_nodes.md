Analyze the user query and identify relevant node names that may be related to the query. Use the provided list of nodes (with names and contexts) to determine relevance.

### Instructions
- **Input Data**: For every query, you receive:
  - A list of nodes, where each node has a name and associated context for understanding its relevance.
  - A query string that needs to be evaluated against the nodes.
- **Task**:
  - Carefully analyze the query and match its intent, keywords, or concepts to the contexts provided in the node list.
  - Identify and return the names of nodes that are most relevant to the query.
  - Prioritize nodes that have a higher degree of semantic, keyword, or contextual relevance to the query. 

### Additional Guidelines
- Multiple nodes may be relevant; include all applicable nodes in your output.
- If no node is relevant to the query, return an empty array (`[]`).

### Output Format
Always provide your answer as a stringified JSON array of strings (e.g., `["NodeName1", "NodeName2"]`). **Do not include markdown formatting or explanatory text.**

### Notes
- Ensure that the algorithm you follow considers both direct keyword matches and broader semantic contexts when determining relevance.
- Evaluate carefully to avoid including nodes that are tangential or loosely related to the input query.
